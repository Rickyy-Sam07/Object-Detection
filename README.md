# Object Detection using YOLO

This project implements object detection using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, version 3), a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm. YOLOv3 is known for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the YOLOv3 object detection model on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip package manager
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the YOLOv3 weights:

   Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights file (`yolov3.weights`) from the official YOLO website or use the `wget` command:

   ```bash
   wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
   ```

### Usage

1. Run object detection on an image:

   ```bash
   python detect_image.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

   This will detect objects in the specified image and display the results.

2. Run object detection on a video:

   ```bash
   python detect_video.py --video path/to/your/video.mp4
   ```

   This will detect objects in the specified video file and output a new video with bounding boxes around detected objects.

### Customization

- **Model Configuration**: Modify `yolov3.cfg` for different YOLOv3 configurations.
- **Classes**: Modify `coco.names` to customize the classes YOLOv3 detects.
- **Thresholds**: Adjust detection confidence thresholds in the scripts (`detect_image.py`, `detect_video.py`) as needed.
